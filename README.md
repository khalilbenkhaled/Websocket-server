# Websocket-server

A Websocket server written in PHP- and by 'scratch', I mean using only PHP's built-in libraries.
The server is capable of: 
- The HTTP handshake that initiates a WebSocket connection. 
- Adding the connection to a "room". 
- Listening to messages on the server. 
- Redirecting messages from the server to the concerned users.
